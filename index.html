    <h3 id='bda696'>Baseball Prediction Model</h3>
    <p>A <a href=https://github.com/timand32/bda696>still in-the-works repository</a> for BDA696: Machine Learning Engineering (a class I'm currently taking). Uses Python and currently only contains homework assignments. The final project will be a containerized and deployable model.</p>
    <p>Ultimate goal of the project is to build a model for predicting baseball game outcomes.</p>

    <li>
        <b>Linux</b> ~ 
        Installed a dual boot of Ubuntu after since BDA696 requires us to run Bash scripts.
        I'm enjoying things so far. I plan to try configuring ArchLinux on another partition over Thanksgiving break.
