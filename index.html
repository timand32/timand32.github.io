    <h2 id='about'>About</h2>

    <p> Graduate Teaching/Research Assistant and 2nd-year student in San Diego State's M.S. in Big Data Analytics program.</p>

    <p>Prospective thesis aimed at developing an analytic tool/workflow in Python to analyze the semantic, temporal, and spatial dimensions of short text documents.</p>

    <p>Very familiar with the programming languages Python and C++ from academic projects and personal study.</p>

    <p>Currently open to part-time work starting in the Spring 2022 semester or full-time work starting Summer 2022.</p>

    <h3 id='bda696'>Baseball Prediction Model</h3>

    <p>
        A <a href=https://github.com/timand32/bda696>still in-the-works repository</a> for BDA696: Machine Learning Engineering (a class I'm currently taking). 
        Uses Python and currently only contains homework assignments. The final project will be a containerized and deployable model.</p>

    <p>Ultimate goal of the project is to build a model for predicting baseball game outcomes.</p>

    <h3 id='pic10c-ptg'>Procedural Terrain Generator</h3>

    <p>
        An <a href=https://github.com/brunostandard/pic10c-ptg>old repository</a> made during my undergraduate for <a href="https://www.pic.ucla.edu/">PIC10C</a>: Advanced Programming. Uses C++ and the Qt Framework.
        My team-member forked our private repository as a public one (and also wrote a nice description in the readme).
    </p>


    <p>
        The project compiles into a GUI application that generates a terrain using a very simplified climate model and an extremely simplified tectonic (meaning literally just procedural noise). 
        Idea was heavily inspired by games such as Civilization and Dwarf Fortress.
    </p>

    <p>
        Repository was made while both of us didn't understand either git or GitHub well: it was never the focus of the class, we just tried to find some way to collaborate. 
        The project itself is <i>not</i> a great example of how to structure a C++, nor a great example of procedural terrain generation.
        I think it at least showcases us trying our bests to get something working with a framework that we were both unfamiliar with.

    <h2 id='learning'>Currently Learning</h2>

    <li>
        <b>Linux</b> ~ 
        Installed a dual boot of Ubuntu after since BDA696 requires us to run Bash scripts.
        I'm enjoying things so far. I plan to try configuring ArchLinux on another partition over Thanksgiving break.
